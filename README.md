How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

With Java programming we have the ability to use Junit tests. These tests allow us to create certain scenarios in our code to ensure that our code works the way it is supposed to. With this we can also ensure that we have the proper security with our code. To be able to interpret the users needs we would need to know what the program is supossed to do and what the user needs to be able to do. We can also use alpha and beta tests in our programs to ensure we receive feedback of what can be fixed. When I design software, I like creating an outline of how I want the program to run and what I need to code in. After that, I start working on my rough draft of the code, improving it. Once I think it's done, I usually have someone test it to see if all the proper functions work and no errors pop up.
